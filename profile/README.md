# Luncher Kubernetes Engine 1 (LKE1)

*Extend the life of your Rancher Kubernetes Engine 1 (RKE1) clusters and enjoy the latest Kubernetes updates and security patches.*

# Why Does This Exist

* Enjoy the latest Kubernetes patches and security updates in Rancher Kubernetes Engine 1 clusters, all while upgrading to versions at your own pace
* No need to migrate or fully rebuild your clusters from RKE1 to LKE1 - just drop our configuration into Rancher and choose whichever LKE1 version suits you best

# How Does It Work

Luncher Kubernetes Engine 1 (LKE1) is a fork of Rancher Kubernetes Engine 1 (RKE1). It was conceived to create versions of Kubernetes that can run in existing clusters, that SUSE themselves did not want to create. LKE1 is built on the exact same open source technologies as RKE1, and is fully compatible with Rancher.

If you choose to use LK1 all you have to do is change a few lines of configuration in your existing Rancher instance and LKE1 versions will appear as available updates for clusters, right alongside the existing RKE1 versions. We already have versions of LKE1 for Kubernetes 1.33.2, so you don't have to be stranded on RKE1 1.32.x and Rancher 2.11.x with no support!
